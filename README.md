Project Title: Health and Medicine Data Classification

Associated Tasks: Classification

Instances: 253,680

Subject Area: Health and Medicine

Feature Type: Categorical, Integer

Features: 21


Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
    Feature Selection:
        - Selected relevant features such as BMI, blood pressure, and dietary habits based on domain knowledge and initial correlation analysis.

    Normalization:
        - Applied Min-Max scaling to normalize numerical variables like age and cholesterol levels.


Models Explored:
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Random Forest
    - Gradient Boosting
    - Adaptive Boosting
    - Bagging Classifier
    - Rationale for Model Selection:
    - The Bagging Classifier was selected due to its superior accuracy compared to other models, achieving an accuracy score of 84%.


Metrics:
    Evaluated model performance using:
        - Accuracy
        - Precision
        - Recall

    Cross-Validation:
        - Conducted cross-validation to assess model robustness and generalizability.
